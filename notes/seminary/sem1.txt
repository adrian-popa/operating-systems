I. Commands:

ls -l /etc - lists the content of a specific folder (etc being a path*)
   -a
   -all

 / - path divider in UNIX


 - Regular expressions rules:

1. Every character in a regular expression can have two meanings - normal / special (\ - escape character to switch between)
2. Depending on the context of the program used, special meaning is with / without the '\'

 . - matches any single character
 \ - escape character, changes meaning between special / normal
 [abc] - any character from the list 'abc'
 [a-z] - any lowercase letter in the range 'a-z'
  A-Z - uppercase
  0-9 - digits
 [^0-9] - any character except '0-9': ^ (negation)
 [^09-] - anything except '09-'

 ^ - beginning of line
 $ - end of line
 \< - beginning of word
 \> - end of word
 \(  \) - group of characters into an expression
 * - previous expression 0 or more times
 \+ - previous expression 1 or more times
 \? - previous expression 0 or once
 \{a, b\} - previous expression at least a times and at most b times
 \/ - logical OR

Examples:

 [a-zA-Z02468] - all the letters (lower and uppercase) and the even digits
 [ \t] - space and tab
 ^[^0-9]\+$ - any character that is not a digit appears one or more times
 \([Nn][Oo] \)\+ - matches 'NO_no_No '


 Grep:

 grep [-options] "regExpr" file.txt - searches for matches of the regExpr string in file.txt 
      -i - case insensitive	File*.txt
      -v display lines that do not match
      -q - 0 if found, 1 if not found
      -c - count lines
      -o - only matching part of a matching line

 /etc/passwd
 username:password:user-id:group-id:user-info:home-directory:shell

Exercises:

a) all lines containing "dan"
 grep "dan" /etc/passwd

b) grep -i "^dan:" /etc/passwd

c) users without digits in username
 grep "^[^0-9]\+:" /etc/passwd

d) grep -i "^[^:]*[aeiou][^:]*[aeiou][^:]*:" /etc/passwd

e) grep -i "^[^:]* \([aeiou][^:]*\)\{5,\}:" /etc/passwd

f) grep -v "bash$" /etc/passwd
